# Netflix GPT

Netflix GPT is a web application built using **React + Vite** that combines the functionality of Netflix-like movie browsing and Firebase-based authentication with a GPT-powered movie search. Users can log in, browse movies, search for related movies (e.g., "3 Idiots like film"), and get movie recommendations using GPT.

## Features

- **User Authentication with Firebase**: Sign up, login, and logout using Firebase Authentication (supports Google and email/password).
- **Netflix-style UI**: Display popular, trending, and top-rated movies in a slick, Netflix-inspired UI.
- **GPT-Powered Movie Search**: Search for related movies using GPT. Type in a movie like "3 Idiots" and get recommendations for similar films.
- **Movie Categories**: Browse movies by genre, including now playing, popular, top rated, and more.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
